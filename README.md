<h4>Hello Everyone</h4>
<p> This project totally deals with the stress and the stress hormones are analysed and further the stress levels are detected using offline EEG dataset. Statistical feature extraction process is used to extract essential time-frequency characteristics from the EEG recordings after the EEG signal has been pre-processed to remove disturbances. Features are extracted in offline dataset. Utiliz- ing a split of the retrieved attributes, stress levels are determined using Deep Learning Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier. This technique is novel in that it modifies the CNNâ€™s convolution kernel to accommodate the input of EEG pre-processed feature extracted data.We evaluate our approach on the DEAP dataset , which contains EEG signals from 32 subjects under various emotional states. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in stress detection, with an accuracy of around 94%. This system revealed that the efficiency to detect stress level using brain waves dataset.</p>
